# Data Analysis Portfolio
This repository contains data analysis projects on pretty much any topic I find interesting using the **OSEMN** approach. Using this approach I find myself continuing to refine my skills in properly cleaning and organizing data, uncovering patterns, generating meaningful insights, and clearly communicating my findings. 

You can find the projects in their respective folders containing Python and SQL code, and a Power BI dashboard.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, seaborn, numpy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (Postgres)
- Power BI

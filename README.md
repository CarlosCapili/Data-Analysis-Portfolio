# Data Analysis Portfolio
This repository contains complete data analysis projects using datasets of various topics. Every project folder contains a summary featuring the source data, tools and technologies used, findings, and visualizations. 

## Data Analysis Framework
The complete end-to-end data analysis process is used for every project - if not, then as much as the process that can be followed.
1. Data collection (Kaggle, Web Scraping, Data.gov, etc.)
2. Cleaning and transformation (Removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardize formats, validate ranges, rename columns, convert data types, add new features, etc)
3. Exploration
4. Interpretation and visualization
